# Email-Spam-Classification-and-Prediction
A Python project that utilizes Logistic Regression to build an effective spam email filter. This filter classifies incoming emails as spam or non-spam (ham) with high precision, enhancing email security and organization.

# Introduction
In the digital age, email communication is essential, but the constant influx of spam emails can be overwhelming and pose security risks. This project addresses this problem by implementing a spam email filter using Logistic Regression. The filter is trained on labeled datasets, and it demonstrates a high level of accuracy, making it a valuable tool for users.

# Features
1. Utilizes Logistic Regression for email classification.
2. Preprocesses email data using TF-IDF Vectorization.
3. Achieves a 96% accuracy on both training and test datasets.
4. Enhances email security and organization.
